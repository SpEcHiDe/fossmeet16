<p>
<b>February is known for 3 things.</b> Valentine's day, leap years, and generally being dull and miserable. While we don't necessarily have anything against the first two, at least we can do something about the last one!
And so, this set of instructions is to make it easier for you ( and us ) to participate in and enjoy all the workshops we have arranged .

</p>
</div>
<div class="text-hint" id="instructions">
<ol>
<li>One thing you should know,  there are LIMITED number of seats in some of the popular workshops. Act fast so that you dont miss out on any awesome workshop.
<li>Online registration – which is the easiest way for you to 'act fast’. We will be providing you a unique ID via email once you make the payment online, using which you can provide us with the list of your preferred workshops. FCFS rule applied here (First Come First Served).
    <br>If you wish to register online, then , <b>25<sup>th</sup> February</b> is the deadline.
<li>In case you are not able to register online, you can still register for FOSSMEET '16 by coming here (NIT Calicut). College ID (for students)/ Photo ID (for professionals), is mandatory.
<li>A FOSSMeet '16 ID shall be provided at the registration desk. It shall be your ticket into the workshops you wish to attend (Meaning, take care of the FOSSMeet ID!).
<li>Even if you have registered online, you SHOULD report to the Registration Desk and provide your College ID (for students)/ Photo ID (for professionals), so that we can confirm your participation and you can pick up your ticket (pronounced: FOSSMeet ID).
<li>Accomodation shall be provided to all the participants who require it. This shall be taken care of at the Registration Desk.
